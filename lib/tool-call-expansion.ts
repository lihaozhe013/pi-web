/**
 * Remembers which tool-call cards the user has expanded (or folded), keyed by
 * toolCallId.
 *
 * A streaming assistant message is rendered from the streaming store, then re-rendered
 * from `messages` after `message_end`, and moves into Process details when the run
 * ends. Each of those hops remounts `ToolCallBlock`, and so does the session file's
 * read when the message's key cannot pass to its entry (lib/message-keys.ts), as in
 * a run longer than the first page; otherwise the read keeps the card mounted. Plain
 * component state would collapse a card the user just opened. Keeping the set
 * outside React lets the remounted card start expanded without threading state
 * through every message component.
 *
 * The choice is three-valued (`getToolCallExpansion`): undefined means the user
 * never touched the card, which is what lets the fork open its own defaults
 * (lib/fork-tool-expansion.ts) without overriding a card the user folded.
