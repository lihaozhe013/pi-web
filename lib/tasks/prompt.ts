/**
 * The prompt a task run receives.
 *
 * A task runs in a fresh SDK session rather than a conversation someone drives
 * turn by turn, so the prompt carries the rules a chat session gets from the
 * person: where to work, whether autonomous decisions replace questions, and
 * what the final message must report. Standing instructions are not here: the session receives them
 * as a system-prompt append, so they live with the rest of the instructions.
